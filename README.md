# Call for Code solution Zero hunger: PACHA

[![DEMO](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Website-blue)](https://haydeeesthefany.github.io/pacha_app_FE/#/inicio)

With more than [250 million people potentially on the brink of starvation](https://www.wfp.org/stories/risk-hunger-pandemic-coronavirus-set-almost-double-acute-hunger-end-2020) rapid action is needed to provide food globally. 
At the same time, a profound change in the global agri-food system is needed if we are to feed the more than 820 million hungry people and the [2 billion more people who will be living in the world by 2050](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html)! Increased agricultural productivity and sustainable food production are crucial to help alleviate the risks of hunger.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

One in nine people in the world is currently undernourished; that is, about 815 million people in the world. Most of the people suffering from hunger live in developing countries such as Peru or Colombia, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished. This nutrition problem causes 45% of deaths in children under 5 years of age, three thousand children every year.

### How can technology help?

Technology can help in many ways. By providing farmers with information about possible droughts, floods, price variations on their products in the market and consumption trends through Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, which will allow the farmer to be more assertive in deciding what to produce, getting the most out of their products.

### The idea

With the aim of directly connecting farmers and consumers without the need for intermediaries, Pacha is born, a web platform designed to help farmers make their products more visible to the final consumer, making available to the producer tools based on watson studio and supported by IBM Cloud, taking advantage of market and weather data to develop a price recommendation system for their products and giving suggestions on possible future crops, improving their competitiveness and profitability through Blockchain and artificial intelligence.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
